Ancestral Recombination Graphs (ARGs) describe the complex web of genetic
ancestry that results from individuals inheriting parts of their genomes
through different routes. Classical mathematical formalisms assume that this
ancestry is fully known. We argue that such complete knowledge is unattainable
for modern datasets, and show that these formalisms cannot describe the output
of current methods. We develop an alternative approach that is compatible with
recent methods, and naturally describes many forms of approximate and partial
knowledge.
